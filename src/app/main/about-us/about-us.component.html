                    <p> Most students are disconnected from the real-life world of work and as a result make sub-optimal decisions about their future.
                        <br>
                        <br class="shd">
                        <span class="paragrphspace"></span>
                        Schools simply do not have the time & resources necessary to help all their students
                        access career information and advice that's: 1) on demand 2) up to date 3) high
                        quality 4) based on firsthand experience 5) trustworthy 6) personalised and 7) based
                        on a full reflection of the opportunities out there.

                        <span class="paragrphspace"></span>
                        This all has negative consequences which can be seen in terms of education and
                        career regret, as well as students not realising their full potential. And it's the
                        disadvantaged students who are impacted most.

                            <p>We set ProPair up as a social enterprise (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company" target="_new">community interest company</a> limited by

                                    This means ProPair cannot be sold for private gain and all our net profits are
                                    reinvested back into the enterprise and social mission (check out our legal constitution

                                ProPair and our volunteer-base of professionals and create a financially sustainable
                                & high impact enterprise so we can: (i) provide our service free to disadvantaged young people and (ii) achieve our long term goal of donating 100% of
